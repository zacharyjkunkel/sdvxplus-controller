# sdvxplus-controller

This is my fully custom Sound Voltex (sdvx) controller that has enough buttons to play pretty much any other mania style rhythm game.

# Inside of the device
My soldering job definitely could be better, but its been a while since I've soldered anything.

# Notes
- The case, knobs and keycaps were designed in Fusion 360 and 3d printed by me.
- Code written in Arduino using the Keyboard, Mouse, and Encoder libraries.
- Using standard mechanical keyboard switches - in this case Kailh Box Navy switches
- The microcontroller is a SparkFun Qwiic Pro Micro - USB-C (ATmega32U4)



I was inspired by other projects like  
https://github.com/speedypotato/Pocket-SDVX  
https://github.com/mon/PocketVoltex  
I wanted a device that could handle more inputs so I got to work on making my own.
